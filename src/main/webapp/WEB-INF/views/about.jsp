                        <p>PsychSpace provides an online learning tool for adults to develop healthy habits while understanding the science behind self-motivation, turning ambitions into accomplishments, correcting bad habits, and maintaining new routines. Through this tool, users become students by selecting a topic, a habit they would like to create or correct, and join others with the same goal under the direction of an instructor. Throughout the learning period of a topic, the instructor guides students with daily feedback and lectures that will help students overcome obstacles and work smarter towards their goals. Part of an effort to promote cyberlearning, PsychSpace helps students manage their self-enrolled topics, keep track of their progress during the learning period as well as completed topics, communicate with peers, and receive personalized feedback from instructors proficient in psychology and self-help techniques. To keep both students and instructors well-read and up to date with current research, PsychSpace also provides a newsfeed featuring articles. </p>
