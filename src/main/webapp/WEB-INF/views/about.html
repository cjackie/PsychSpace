                        <p>PsychSpace provides an online self-learning tool for adults to develop healthy habits. This
                            tool will enable users to understand the science behind self-motivation, turning ambitions
                            into accomplishments, correcting bad habits, and maintaining new routines. Users can sign up
                            as students and select courses that would help them create or correct specific habits. As
                            part of an effort to promote cyberlearning, PsychSpace helps students manage their
                            self-enrolled topics, keep track of their progress during the learning period, communicate
                            with peers, and receive personalized feedback from instructors proficient in psychology
                            and self-help techniques.
